        <h1>Wind</h1>
        <p>Cultivate your hunger before you idealize
            Motivate your anger to make them all realize
            Climbing the mountain, never coming down
            Break into the contents, never falling down
            <br>
            My knee is still shaking like I was twelve
            Sneaking out the classroom by the back door <br>
            A man railed at me twice, though, but I didn't care
            Waiting is wasting for people like me
            <br>
            Don't try to live so wise
            Don't cry 'cause you're so right
            Don't dry with fakes or fears
            'Cause you will hate yourself in the end
            Don't try to live so wise
            Don't cry 'cause you're so right
            Don't dry with fakes or fears
            'Cause you will hate yourself in the end
            <br>
